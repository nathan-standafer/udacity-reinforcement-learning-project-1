#  Navigation project submission for Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

A Deep DQN implementation to navigate the Unity Banana Collector environment provided by Udacity.

This impelmentation utilizes a Double DQN stragety to achieve a score of over 13 in about 2500 playthoughs.

All code is in the TrainBananaBrain notebook.  I tried to keep the code as short and simple as possible with comments to focus on my implemenation of the Double DQN.

I ran the code within the privided Udacity training environment.  I had a hard time getting it to run on my PC.  Executing the first cell in the notebook sets up the necessary dependencies when ran on the Udacity environment.
